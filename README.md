# Auth-project

**Project Objective**: The primary goal of this project is to gain practical experience in integrating JWT (JSON Web Token)-based user authentication and authorization into a MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) stack web application.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: The user interface is developed using React and TypeScript.
- **Backend**: The server-side logic is implemented using Express.js. Data is stored in a MongoDB database.
- **User Feedback**: The application leverages the power of the `react-toastify` library to deliver user-friendly toast notifications and provide feedback to users regarding the success or status of their actions.

## API Endpoints

To interact with the application, the following API endpoints are available:

- **POST: /api/signup**: Register a new user.
- **POST: /api/login**: Log in to an existing user account.
- **POST: /api/userVerification**: Verify user details.

### Usage

To get started with the application:

1. Launch the frontend by running: npm start
2. Start the backend server using: npm run dev

This will enable you to interact with the project and experience the JWT-based user authentication and authorization in action.
